## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Market Dynamics
- The **Bangkok Airbnb market is supply over demand**, with a high percentage of available rooms but consistent growth in **new hosts** joining each year.
- Indicates strong host confidence and market expansion potential despite competition.

### 2. Location & Pricing
- **Weak correlation** between price and occupancy rate.  
- **Junior hosts charge 3–5% more** than senior hosts, but this **does not significantly affect occupancy**.  
- Core business and urban zones maintain stable occupancy; peripheral areas show moderate growth potential.

### 3. Listing Structure
- Listings with **4–5 key title components** show **notably higher occupancy rates**.  
- The most impactful title components are:
  - 🏙️ **View** — 45.7%  
  - ✨ **Descriptive Adjectives** — 36.4%  
  - 🚉 **Proximity to Transit** — 36.4%  
- Well-structured titles tend to increase visibility and conversion.

### 4. Amenities
- **Junior hosts** quickly adopt market trends (Wi-Fi, workspaces, self-check-in).  
- **Senior hosts** excel in completeness and reliability of amenities (home appliances, essentials).  
- Peak season amenity preferences differ between **entire homes** and **private rooms**.
  
### 5. Host Experience & Behavior
- **Experience alone** doesn’t ensure higher performance — metrics such as **review rate, response rate, and Superhost status** are stronger predictors of occupancy.  
- Positive correlation between **frequent reviews**, **high response rate**, and **better booking outcomes**.
